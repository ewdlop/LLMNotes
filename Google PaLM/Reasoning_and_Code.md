# Reasoning and Code Generation

## Reasoning

PaLM 2 demonstrates strong capabilities in logic, common sense reasoning, and mathematics.

*   **Symbolic Logic**: Can handle symbolic logic tasks and formal proofs to a certain extent.
*   **Mathematical Problem Solving**: improved performance on math benchmarks (like GSM8K) compared to PaLM 1.

## Code Generation

The model was trained on a massive dataset of source code, making it proficient in programming languages like:

*   Python
*   JavaScript
*   Java
*   C++
*   Go

It can also handle more specialized languages like Verilog and Fortran.

### Use Cases

*   **Code Completion**: Suggesting the next lines of code.
*   **Code Translation**: Converting code from one language to another.
*   **Bug Fixing**: Identifying and suggesting fixes for common coding errors.
*   **Documentation Generation**: automatically generating docstrings and comments for code.
